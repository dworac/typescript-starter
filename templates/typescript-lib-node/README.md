# template.name

This is a template repository for quickly starting a Node.js library project with TypeScript, ESLint, Jest, and a host of other tools set up out of the box. It's designed to help you hit the ground running, providing a solid base from which you can begin developing your project.

## Features

- **TypeScript:** Enjoy the benefits of a statically typed language that compiles down to JavaScript.
- **ESLint:** Catch syntax and style errors before they make it into production.
- **Jest:** Write and run tests to ensure your code's quality and correctness.
- **esbuild:** Use this extremely fast JavaScript bundler and minifier.
- **Husky:** Automate tasks like linting and testing using this Git hook manager.
- **nodemon:** Automatically restart your Node.js application when file changes are detected in the directory.

### Development

To install packages run:

```shell
yarn
```

To start the project in development mode, use the following command:

```shell
yarn start:dev
```

### Production

To build the project for production, use the following command:

```shell
yarn build
```

To start the project in production mode, use the following command:

```shell
yarn start
```

### Other Scripts

Here are some other scripts that could come in handy:

- `lint`: This runs ESLint on your project.
- `lint:fix`: This runs ESLint and automatically fixes any issues that it can.
- `test`: This runs Jest to test your project.
